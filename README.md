The UK (EGTT and EGPX FIRs) controller pack provides the tools to VATSIM UK controllers to control relistically, efficiently and easily on the VATSIM network

A new release will be published in line with each AIRAC cycle (as long as significant changes warrant such a release).

If you wish to contribute, take a look at our contribution guide. The Wiki (a work in progress) also contains more in-depth information about the contents of the controller pack.
